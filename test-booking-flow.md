## 🔄 **New Booking Flow (Like Restaurant Cart)**

### **Step 1: Browse Hotels**
1. Open your app
2. Go to **Hotels** tab
3. Select a hotel
4. Choose room, dates, and guests

### **Step 2: Add to Booking Cart**

3. Choose **"Go to Bookings"** or **"Continue Browsing"**

### **Step 3: Complete Booking**

3. In the Booking Cart section, click **"🛒 Complete Booking"**
4. This takes you to the Payment screen

- ✅ **Complete Booking**: Navigates to payment screen
- ✅ Uses Ghana Cedis (GH₵) currency

### **Home Screen:**
- ✅ Shows real booking count (0 for new users)
- ✅ Updates after bookings are completed
- ✅ Shows savings in Ghana Cedis

## 🆚 **Comparison: Restaurant vs Hotel Flow**

### **Restaurant Flow:**
1. Browse restaurants → Select items → **Add to Cart** → Go to Orders tab → **Pay Now**

### **Hotel Flow (New):**
1. Browse hotels → Select room/dates → **Add to Booking Cart** → Go to Bookings tab → **Complete Booking**

Both flows now work the same way! 🎉

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: New User**
- Home screen shows 0 bookings, 0 orders, GH₵0.00 saved
- Booking cart is empty
- My Bookings is empty

### **Scenario 2: Add Hotel to Cart**

- Should see success message
- Bookings tab should show 1 item in Booking Cart
- Home screen still shows 0 bookings (until payment completed)

### **Scenario 3: Complete Booking**
- Go to Bookings tab → Booking Cart → "Complete Booking"
- Should navigate to Payment screen
- After payment, booking moves to "My Bookings" section
- Home screen updates to show 1 booking

### **Scenario 4: Remove from Cart**

## 🎯 **Benefits of New Flow**

3. **Multiple Bookings**: Can add multiple hotels before paying
4. **Clear Separation**: Pending vs confirmed bookings

2. **Batch Payment**: Consider allowing payment for multiple bookings
3. **Cart Persistence**: Ensure cart survives app restarts
4. **Notifications**: Add notifications for cart reminders

Your hotel booking flow now matches the restaurant ordering experience! 🏨🍽️
