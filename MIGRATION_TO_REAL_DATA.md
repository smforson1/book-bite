# Migration from Mock Data to Real Backend Data

This document outlines the changes made to ensure the BookBite app uses real data from the backend instead of mock data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Context Providers

**HotelContext.tsx:**
- Modified `loadData()` and `getHotels()` methods to:
  - Use real backend data when available
  - Show empty state instead of mock data when backend returns no data or fails
  - Removed fallback to mock data in production

**RestaurantContext.tsx:**
- Modified `loadData()` and `getRestaurants()` methods to:
  - Use real backend data when available
  - Show empty state instead of mock data when backend returns no data or fails
  - Removed fallback to mock data in production

### 2. Updated Mock Data Service

**mockDataService.ts:**
- Modified `initializeMockData()` function to:
  - Only initialize mock data in development mode (`__DEV__`)
  - Initialize empty arrays in production mode instead of mock data
  - Prevent mock data from appearing in production builds

### 3. Updated App Entry Point

**App.tsx:**
- Modified to only call `initializeMockData()` in development mode
- Ensures production builds don't use mock data

### 4. Updated API Configuration

**apiService.ts:**
- Updated `API_CONFIG.baseURL` to point to your actual backend URL in production
- Kept localhost for development mode

## How It Works

1. **Development Mode:** The app will use mock data when running in development mode and no real data is available
2. **Production Mode:** The app will only use real data from your backend
3. **Data Flow:** 
   - App contexts attempt to fetch data from the backend first
   - If successful, real data is displayed
   - If backend returns no data, empty state is shown
   - Mock data is never used in production

## Next Steps

1. Update the production backend URL in `apiService.ts`
2. Deploy your backend to the specified URL
3. Register hotels and restaurants through the manager interface
4. Test that only registered businesses appear in the user feed

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Run the app in development mode to see mock data
2. Update the API URL to point to your running backend
3. Run the app in production mode to see real data
4. Verify that only registered hotels/restaurants appear in the user interface
