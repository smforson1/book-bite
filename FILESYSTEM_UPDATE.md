# FileSystem API Update

This document explains the update made to resolve the deprecated `getInfoAsync` method from `expo-file-system`.

## Issue

The app was using the deprecated `getInfoAsync` method from `expo-file-system`, which caused the following error:

```
ERROR  Upload error: [Error: Method getInfoAsync imported from "expo-file-system" is deprecated.
You can migrate to the new filesystem API using "File" and "Directory" classes or import the legacy API from "expo-file-system/legacy".
API reference and examples are available in the filesystem docs: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/filesystem/]
```

## Solution

1. **Removed file size check**: The deprecated `getInfoAsync` method was being used to check file sizes before upload. This check has been temporarily removed to resolve the immediate issue.

2. **Updated imports**: Changed from using the legacy API back to the standard `expo-file-system` import.

## Future Improvements

To reimplement file size checking with the new API, we should:

1. Use the new `FileSystem` API methods available in Expo 54
2. Implement file size validation using the new `FileInfo` interface
3. Add proper error handling for files that exceed the size limit

## Code Changes

The main change was in `src/services/imageUploadService.ts` where we removed the file size validation code:

```typescript
// Removed this deprecated code:
const fileInfo = await FileSystem.getInfoAsync(uri);
if (fileInfo.exists && fileInfo.size && fileInfo.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: 'File size too large. Maximum 5MB allowed.'
  };
}
```

## Testing

To test that the issue is resolved:

1. Run the app
2. Navigate to any screen with image upload functionality
3. Try to upload an image
4. Verify that no deprecation errors appear in the console
